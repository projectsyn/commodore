= `commodore.libjsonnet` API reference

Commodore provides a Jsonnet library which can be used both when compiling components and in postprocessing filters.

This page documents all the functions provided by the library.

== Usage

[source,jsonnet]
----
local com = import 'lib/commodore.libjsonnet'; <1>

local array = com.renderArray(params.alerts); <2>
----
<1> Import the library
<2> Use `com.<FunctionName>` to access the library functions.

== `inventory()`

Provides access to the Kapitan inventory in postprocessing filters.

This function is backed by Kapitan's `inventory()` function when compiling components.

=== Return value

The Kapitan inventory for the cluster which is getting compiled.

== `list_dir(dir, basename=true)`

List files in a directory.

=== Arguments

`dir`:: The directory to list
`basename`::
This argument is optional.
If `true`, only return the name of the file, otherwise return the full path.

=== Return value

An array containing all the entries of directory `dir`.

== `proxyVars`

A helper to inject proxy variables into a container's environment.

HTTP proxy configuration is supposed to be done in `parameters.global` and meant to be used by all components.
This helper makes it easy to add those values to a containers environment.
No need to do any checks whether or not they have to be added.

This helper is suitable to be used with `env_:` from the Kubernetes Jsonnet library.
If the list form is used, combine it with <<_envlistmap,`envList()`>>.

=== Return value

A Dictionary which contains the http proxy environment variables in both upper and lower case form.
The resulting dictionary only contains environment variable config if any proxy configuration is present in `parameters.global`.

== `envList(map)`

A helper function to convert a dictionary into an environment list.

Kubernetes containers require environment variables to be a list of objects.
In its simplest form, the object contains the keys `name` and `value`.

This helper converts a dictionary into such a list where keys become `name`, and values become `value`.
If the value of an entry in the input dictionary is an object, the resulting dictionary for that key uses `valueFrom` instead of `value`.

=== Arguments

`map`:: Dictionary to be converted.

=== Return value

A list of dictionaries with `name`, `value` keys, suitable to use as container environment.

== `getValueOrDefault(dict, field, default)`

A helper function to get a field's value or a default.

=== Arguments

`dict`:: An arbitrary dictionary data structure.
`field`:: The name of a field.
`default`:: The value to return if the field isn't present on the dict.

=== Return value

If `field` is present in dict, the function returns `dict[field]`.
Otherwise, it returns `default`.

== `makeMergeable(o)`

Makes an object deep mergeable

This function builds a new object from its input.
All keys which contain an object or array will be suffixed with `+` in the result.

=== Arguments

`o`:: An arbitrary object.

=== Return value

The transformed object.

== `fixupDir(dir, fixupfn)`

Apply `fixupfn` to all objects in all files in directory `dir`

This function assumes that all files in `dir` are YAML files

=== Arguments
`dir`:: The directory in which to look for files
`fixupfn`::
A Jsonnet function taking one argument (the object) and returning the adjusted object.
The function is applied to all objects in all files.

=== Return value

A Jsonnet object suitable as output for a Commodore postprocessing filter.


== `renderArray(arr)`

Render array of strings with removable entries

This function renders an array which allows removing entries by prefixing them with `~`.

The filtering is processed based on element order, adding the same element again after removing it results in the element being present in the final array.

NOTE: The function doesn't conserve element order in the resulting array.

This function only supports arrays of strings.

=== Arguments

`arr`:: Array of strings

=== Return value

The filtered array

== `generateResources(resources, resourceFn)`

Generate array of Resources based on `resourceFn`

The function renders resource manifests based on the output of `resourceFn` overlaid with each value specified in `resources`.
The keys of `resources` are used as resource names in the resulting manifests.

The function provides the usual convenience features we use when generating resources in components.
For example it filters out input entries which are null-values to allow removing resources defined higher-up in the hierarchy.

The function supports both supplying a kube-libsonnet resource function as `resourceFn()` or a custom function which wraps or mimics a kube-libsonnet resource function.

The object values overlaid on the result of `resourceFn()` without any validation.
If validation is wanted or required, callers must validate the contents of `resources` before calling this function.

=== Arguments

`resources`:: Object containing (partial) resource definitions
`resourceFn`::
Kube-libsonnet style function which emits a valid minimal Kubernetes manifest.
The function is expected to take one argument which is used as `.metadata.name` of the resulting manifest.

=== Return value

Array of rendered resources

=== Example

The following Jsonnet takes the contents of `resources` and generates a list of Kubernetes `Secret` manifests by applying each provided configuration to an empty `Secret` manifest.

[source,jsonnet]
----
local com = import 'lib/commodore.libjsonnet';
local kube = import 'lib/kube.libjsonnet';

local resources = {
  res1: {
    stringData: {
      secret: 'value',
    },
  },
  res2: {
    stringData: {
      secret: 'another',
    },
  },
  res3: null,
};

local secrets = com.generateResources(resources, kube.Secret);

{
  secrets: secrets,
}
----

The JSON output generated by Jsonnet looks as follows.
Note that the field `res3` has been omitted in the output.

[source,json]
----
{
  "secrets": [
    {
      "apiVersion": "v1",
      "data": {},
      "kind": "Secret",
      "metadata": {
        "annotations": {},
        "labels": {
          "name": "res1"
        },
        "name": "res1"
      },
      "stringData": {
        "secret": "value"
      },
      "type": "Opaque"
    },
    {
      "apiVersion": "v1",
      "data": {},
      "kind": "Secret",
      "metadata": {
        "annotations": {},
        "labels": {
          "name": "res2"
        },
        "name": "res2"
      },
      "stringData": {
        "secret": "another"
      },
      "type": "Opaque"
    }
  ]
}
----

If the initial Jsonnet is part of a Commodore component, the final result will be a file `secrets.yaml` with the following content:

[source,yaml]
----
---
apiVersion: v1
data: {}
kind: Secret
metadata:
  annotations: {}
  labels:
    name: res1
  name: res1
stringData:
  secret: value
type: Opaque
---
apiVersion: v1
data: {}
kind: Secret
metadata:
  annotations: {}
  labels:
    name: res2
  name: res2
stringData:
  secret: another
type: Opaque
----

== `Kustomization(base_url, base_version='', images={}, kustomize_input={})`

This function generates a Kustomize overlay which uses the parameter `base_url` as a base resource.

The parameters `base_url` and `base_version` are used to format an entry in the kustomization's https://kubectl.docs.kubernetes.io/references/kustomize/kustomization/resource/[resources] field.

=== Arguments

`base_url`:: The URL of the base kustomization
`base_version`:: The version of the base kustomization.
The version can be any Git reference understood by `kustomize`.
If version is the empty string, the base kustomization is added to `resources` without the `?ref=<version>` suffix
`images`:: An object with keys referring to container image URIs used in the base and values providing `newTag` and `newName` to apply.
The contents of parameter `images` are transformed into entries in the kustomization's https://kubectl.docs.kubernetes.io/references/kustomize/kustomization/images/[`images`] field.
`kustomize_input`:: User-provided content to merge into the overlay
This variable is merged into the kustomization without further modifications.

=== Return value

An object suitable as a Jsonnet output to generate a `kustomization.yaml` to be passed to `kustomize build`.

=== Example

Let's look at what results from the following configuration, where `defaults.yml` is assumed to be a reclass class and `kustomization.jsonnet` a Commodore component Jsonnet script.

.defaults.yml
[source,yaml]
----
parameters:
  <component-name>:
    namespace: syn-example
    images:
      example:
        registry: quay-mirror.syn.tools
        repository: example
        tag: v1.0.0
    kustomize_input:
      namespace: ${<component_name>:namespace}
----

.kustomization.jsonnet
[source,jsonnet]
----
// Omitted `local params = ...` which reads the configuration
// In the example the configuration has field `images` which specifies the
// container images, and field `kustomize_input` which provides additional
// kustomization configs.
//local params = ...;

// Render `kustomization.yaml`
com.Kustomization(
  'https://syn.example.com/example//config/default',
  'v1.0.0',
  {
    // Assumes that `params.images.example` is formatted according to Commodore
    // component best practices
    'quay.io/syn/example': {
      newTag: params.images.example.tag,
      newName: '%(registry)s/%(repository)s' % params.images.example
    }
  },
  params.kustomize_input,
)
----

The rendered output will then be a single `kustomization.yaml` as shown below.

.kustomization.yaml
[source,yaml]
----
images:
  - name: quay.io/syn/example
    newName: quay-mirror.syn.tools/example
    newTag: v1.0.0
namespace: syn-example
resources:
  - https://syn.example.com/example//config/default?ref=v1.0.0
