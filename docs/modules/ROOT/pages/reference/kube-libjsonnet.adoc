= `kube.lib(j)sonnet`

Commodore ensures that the https://github.com/bitnami-labs/kube-libsonnet/blob/master/kube.libsonnet[`bitnami-labs/kube-libsonnet/kube.libsonnet`] file is available as `lib/kube.libjsonnet`.

As the upstream project isn't actively maintained, the Commodore maintainers update the file to keep it compatible with the latest Kubernetes versions.
The file was originally imported from release https://github.com/bitnami-labs/kube-libsonnet/releases/tag/v1.19.0[`v1.19.0`].

It's planned to switch to https://github.com/jsonnet-libs/k8s-libsonnet[`jsonnet-libs/k8s-libsonnet`] in the future.
A migration guide will be provided.

[IMPORTANT]
It's not possible to override the provided `kube.libsonnet` using a component provided Jsonnet Bundler file.
