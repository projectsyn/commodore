= Compilation metadata reporting

The reporting is implemented according to https://syn.tools/syn/SDDs/0031-component-version-tracking.html[SDD 0031 - Central Component Version tracking].

Commodore will only report metadata for catalog compilations that result in a new catalog commit which was successfully pushed to the catalog repository.

Currently, Commodore reports the following metadata:

* Component instance URLs, versions, subpaths, and Git commit hashes
* Package URLs, versions, subpaths, and Git commit hashes
* Global repo URL, version and Git commit hash
* Tenant repo URL, version and Git commit hash
* Commodore Python package version and Git version
* The timestamp of the successful compilation


Commodore uses the same data that's reported to Lieutenant to generate the catalog commit message.
