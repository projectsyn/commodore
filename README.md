This repository is part of Project Syn.

See [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/projectsyn/commodore/releases) for changelogs of each release version of Commodore.

See [DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/r/projectsyn/commodore) for pre-built Docker images of Commodore.

Commodore is [published on PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/syn-commodore/)

## Overview

Commodore provides opinionated tenant-aware management of [Kapitan](https://kapitan.dev/) inventories and templates.
Commodore uses Kapitan for the heavy lifting of rendering templates and resolving a hierachical configuration structure.

Commodore introduces the concept of a component, which is a bundle of Kapitan templates and associated Kapitan classes which describe how to render the templates.
Commodore fetches any components that are required for a given configuration before running Kapitan, and sets up symlinks so Kapitan can find the component classes.

Commodore also supports additional processing on the output of Kapitan, such as patching in the desired namespace for a Helm chart which has been rendered using `helm template`.

## System Requirements

* Python 3.8 - 3.11 with `python3-dev` and `python3-venv` updated
* [jsonnet-bundler](https://github.com/jsonnet-bundler/jsonnet-bundler)
* `libmagic` (install with `brew install libmagic` on macOS)

## Getting started

1. Recommended: create a new virtual environment
    ```console
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```
1. Install commodore from PyPI
    ```console
    pip install syn-commodore
    ```
1. <a name="getting_started_jsonnet"></a>Install jsonnet-bundler according to upstream [documentation](https://github.com/jsonnet-bundler/jsonnet-bundler#install).

1. For Commodore to work, you need to run an instance of [Lieutenant](https://syn.tools/syn/tutorials/getting-started.html#_kickstart_lieutenant) somewhere
   (locally is fine too).


1. Setup a `.env` file to configure Commodore (don't use quotes):

   ```shell
   # URL of Lieutenant API
   COMMODORE_API_URL=https://lieutenant-api.example.com/
   # Lieutenant API token
   COMMODORE_API_TOKEN=<my-token>
   # Your local user ID to be used in the container (optional, defaults to root)
   USER_ID=<your-user-id>
   # Your username to be used in the commits (optional, defaults to your local git config)
   COMMODORE_USERNAME=<your name>
   # Your user email to be used in the commits (optional, defaults to your local git config)
   COMMODORE_USERMAIL=<your email>
   ```
1. Run commodore
    ```console
    commodore
    ```

## Run Commodore with poetry

### Additional System Requirements

* [Poetry](https://github.com/python-poetry/poetry) 1.3.0+
* Docker


1. Install requirements

   Install poetry according to the upstream
   [documentation](https://github.com/python-poetry/poetry#installation).

   Create the Commodore environment:

    ```console
    poetry install
    ```

    Install jsonnet-bundler according to upstream [documentation](https://github.com/jsonnet-bundler/jsonnet-bundler#install).


1. Finish setup as described [above](#getting_started_jsonnet)

1. Run Commodore

   ```console
   poetry run commodore
   ```

1. Start hacking on Commodore

   ```console
   poetry shell
   ```

   - Write a line of test code, make the test fail
   - Write a line of application code, make the test pass
   - Repeat

   Note: Commodore uses the [Black](https://github.com/psf/black) code formatter, and its formatting is encforced by CI.

1. Run linting and tests

   Auto format with autopep8
   ```console
   poetry run autopep
   ```

   List all Tox targets
   ```console
   poetry run tox -lv
   ```

   Run all linting and tests
   ```console
   poetry run tox
   ```

   Run just a specific target
   ```console
   poetry run tox -e py38
   ```


## Run Commodore in Docker

**IMPORTANT:** After checking out this project, run `mkdir -p catalog inventory dependencies` in it before running any Docker commands.
This will ensure the folders are writable by the current user in the context of the Docker container.

A docker-compose setup enables running Commodore in a container.
The environment variables are picked up from the local `.env` file.
By default your `~/.ssh/` directory is mounted into the container and an `ssh-agent` is started.
You can skip starting an agent by setting the `SSH_AUTH_SOCK` env variable and mounting the socket into the container.

1. Build the Docker image inside of the cloned Commodore repository:

```console
docker-compose build
```

1. Run the built image:

```console
docker-compose run commodore catalog compile $CLUSTER_ID
```
